#Exam-Q2: Suppose that you have x as an integer and y as a string representing an integer. 
# For instance, x is 4 and y is '14'. Write a program to print out the arithmetic sum of the x and y. 
# In the example, 18 would be printed.

#Test Code 15,"45"
x = 15
y= "45"

theSum = x + int(y)
print(theSum)
